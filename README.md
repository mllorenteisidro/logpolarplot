# logpolarplot
Plot in a wind-rose like diagram any number of orientation-frequency data

The aim of this project is to build a function into OCTAVE GNU 5.2.0 capable of plotting data in a circular manner (polar-plot like or wind-rose-like plot), so I have frequency concentric circles log-scaled (or log-distributed) vs direction (as a meassure of angle in degrees from the true north eastwards (+) or westwards (-).

Hence the function requires two vectors of the same dimensions. One would have values from 0 to 360 degrees (where 0=North and 90ยบ=East), and the other vector would be a number of freequency (usually anything from 1E1 to 1E5).

I am still working on error handling. It should include: wrong number of arguments (too few or too many) and wrong length for inputs. Not there yet.

The rest seems to be working fine.

In order to save the plot, just add this line after calling the function: 

print -dpng -Sxsize "-S800,730" rose.png  % The size should bring a perfect circle output.
